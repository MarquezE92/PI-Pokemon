# Individual Project - Henry Pokemon - Estefan√≠a

<img height="150" src="./pokemon.png" />

**First -deployed- project made as an evaluative instance at [Soy Henry](https://www.soyhenry.com/)'s web development bootcamp.**

**This Single Page Application lets you search through the first generation first 40 pokemons through the use of an external API. You can sort them alphabetically, or by their attack; you can also filter them either by one type or by origin - meaning, those brought by the API or created with the use of a controlled form.**

**The search bar lets you navigate between pokemons by name, and by clicking in one of them the user can take a look at a detail page witch shows you the pokemon in movement and more information than the displayed in the principal page.**
